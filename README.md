# Real-Time-Identi-cation-of-Human-Faces-Computer-Vision-
The Mean Shift LBPH algorithm for identiÔ¨Åcation of Human Faces in a Video sequence. Extended the algorithm to handle scale changes. Implementation was robust to blur,deformation and partial occlusions. 

# Requirements
1) Python 3.x
2) OpenCV

# Installation
``git clone https://github.com/shivam1423/Real-Time-Identi-cation-of-Human-Faces-Computer-Vision-.git``

cd Real-Time-Identi-cation-of-Human-Faces-Computer-Vision-

Run ``python face recognition CV.py``
